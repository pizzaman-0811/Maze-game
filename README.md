# Nightmare Maze Game

## Overview
Nightmare Maze is a Java-based maze exploration game where players navigate procedurally generated dark mazes to find keys, avoid ghosts, and escape through doors. The game offers three difficulty levels with increasing challenges and atmospheric gameplay.

## Features
- Three difficulty levels:
  - **Level 1**: Full maze visibility.
  - **Level 2**: Limited visibility; collect flashlights to see more.
  - **Level 3**: Ghosts patrol the maze; avoid contact to prevent being sent back to start.
- Procedurally generated mazes with random placement of doors, keys, and items.
- Inventory system to collect keys and flashlights.
- Save and load game progress.
- Simple console-based user interface.

## Controls
- Move using **W** (up), **A** (left), **S** (down), **D** (right).
- Use menu options to start, save, load, or exit the game.

## How to Play
- Start at the bed (fixed starting position).
- Explore the maze to find the key.
- Collect flashlights in Levels 2 and 3 to expand your visibility.
- Avoid ghosts in Level 3; touching them sends you back to the bed.

- After clearing all levels, choose to play again, select a level, or quit.
